For this week we pretty much finished the entire frontend. The backend was implemented with Firebase so now all we have to
do is import the library and hook up the front end button handlers to the backend. I was really busy this week so I mainly
worked on polishing up the frontend for some of the pages that I worked on. I also made navigation handlers for my frontend
screens so that somewhat hidden screens that other people were working on could easily be accessed by navigating through
the screen. I also read through the Firebase documentation when I had some free time to get familiar with how the backend
is going to work. In addition, I looked over some pull requests and the changes made to the repository so that I won't be
too surprised when I continue working on my portion.

For next week, I'm planning to go get the backend fully functional with the pages that I worked on. Since I already created
the backbone structure in the program with button handler functions, all I really have to do is figure out the methods I
need to call with Firebase, and write a couple lines for each button handler that requires backend interaction. Getting the
backend fully integrated is the main priority and if I still have some time remaining then I will do a lot of debugging
to make sure that everything is working as it is supposed to.

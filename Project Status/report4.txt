For this week we finished working on the backend. I was really busy this week so I didn't work on the project a whole
lot. I looked over the implementation of the backend by one of the group members. The backend was pretty barebones but
it looked like everything we needed was there so I began to connect the pages that I worked on to the backend.
I previously created empty function calls for the button handlers on the pages I made so all I really had to do was
import the backend module interfaces and begin using them in the handlers. So, I worked on some of the button handlers
to interface with the backend but we haven't met yet to get everyone up to speed on how to test the the app with the
backend so it's just untested code right now.

For next week, I'm planning to get the testing infrastructure for the backend so that it can run locally and we can
continue to link up the frontend to the backend. Some of the pages for the frontend are still not complete so I might
also work on some of them so we can finish adding all of the features to the frontend. After that, we should be pretty
much done with the project. If we manage to finishe all of this next week, then we can have an entire week for testing
and bug fixes.

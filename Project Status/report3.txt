For this week I set up the profile page for our app. I based the design off of Instagram's profile page. I added multiple
clickable fields that show the information of the user and after clicking each of the fields, the app shows a new screen
with the information from the field in a text input box so the user can edit. After clicking "Done," the app will then
call whatever function handler that was passed to it. This is so that when the backend gets set up the function handler
can send information to the database updating the information of the user. With this, the frontend design and function
interfaces should be pretty much done and we can start focusing exclusively on backend from here on out.

For next week, the plan is to allow users to get the backend set up so that users can add tags to posts and so that
users can filter posts with tags. In addition, our group plans to get a scrollable feed set up and running so that
users can browse interesting content created by other users that are similar to their content preferences. Another
group member is still having issues with getting the camera to work but once that is done and the backend is set up
we should be able to upload data to the server and have everyone run tests on whether the app is querying correctly.
We are a falling a little bit behind schedule because getting everyone set up and familiar with the libraries and
frameworks was more of a hassle than expected but now development is smooth and there shouldn't be many problems. There
are two weeks of debugging time in our schedule so we have a bit of a buffer zone. The main thing we need now is to get
the backend all set up because without that a lot of the other tasks that need to be done will be roadblocked.

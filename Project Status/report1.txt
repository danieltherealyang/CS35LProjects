For this week my group worked on figuring out what tech stack we would use for the project. We went over the Figma design
that one of our members drafted. We decided that for our user interface, we would have 5 buttons at the bottom that
would: 1. open the camera and upload a picture 2. home page 3. groups 4. search by filter 5. user profile.
We assigned tasks to work on the different components that our app frontend would need. To organize all our 
components we decided to use UI Kitten.

The main work that I did this week was setting up all of the infrastructure to get a working development environment.
I cloned the git repository and installed yarn to run the development server. I also installed ExpoGo so that when making
the app we could see if it was working on IOS. Getting the node development server and the ExpoGo set up was a bit
challenging since I had to figure out what configurations and settings to use to get it all working but we figured
everything out eventually. 

For next week, the task I chose was to create the landing page. The landing page would be the page that displays the sign
up and login buttons. The landing page might take less work than the other pages so if that's the case then I might do 
the sign in page as well. The plan for next week is to get familiar with Typescript and React Native so that developing
the rest of the app runs smoothly.

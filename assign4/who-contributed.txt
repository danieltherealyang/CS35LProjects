I used the command: git grep -n 'Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.'
This gave the output: northamerica:896:# and wrote "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."

From this output, I could tell that the next step to take was to look at the commit history of the 'northamerica' file
and see how that line got added to the repository.

I used the command: git log -p -- northamerica > ../NA.txt
This command searches the git commits for changes to the file 'northamerica' which was found to contain the sentence
using the previous command. The command the pipes the output to a file called NA.txt.

Looking through this file, I then found that the commit that first introduced this line into the repository was:
commit c12b432741eed9a422fbf99fa27af6e7a941d88b
Author: Arthur David Olson <ado@elsie>
Date:   Thu Dec 21 11:43:42 1995 -0500

    Eggert changes

    SCCS-file: northamerica
    SCCS-SID: 7.20

This commit had the quote included as an addition to the repository so we can conclude that this is the point where the
infringing quote was introduced.

Aside from this commit, the line was also changed in the commit:
commit c344c562c19dbdc905bb3edb3faa78cdf509ba2d
Author: Arthur David Olson <olsona@elsie>
Date:   Mon Jan 30 08:59:12 2006 -0500

    Eggert mods

    SCCS-file: northamerica
    SCCS-SID: 7.88

where the quote itself was not modified but the word 'writes' was changed to 'wrote.'

There was another commit:
commit c8f960ec72312d0d4368fc025a57812d8f8021f2
Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
Date:   Mon Sep 2 08:09:06 2013 -0700

    * backward: Move some links back to primary files.

	[commit message omitted]

where instead of enclosing the quote with `` '' those characters were changed to double quotes "".

From these commits, we can see that the quote was introduced by Arthur David Olson in Dec 21 1995 and from there, only
minor changes were made to the line containing the quote, none of which modified the actual content of the quote itself.
